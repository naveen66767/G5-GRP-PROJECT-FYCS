They never pressured me , just check in once every few days or maybe even a week. Nothing overwhelming. Finally on a Saturday i decided to pull the trigger on a gorgeous 2018 laferrari. I asked them to send me some videos and more pictures of the under carriage. I got them within hour or so from asking. Unreal. I was than put in touch with the Exotic team. They went over all the options and even text me the rates and everything , unreal experience, so smooth. I did this all From my cabin in PA. We got the deal done and i was ready to get my car. We worked out a great price on the shipping. they than told me 4-10 days to have my ferrari in PA.There support was so amazing.Exotic wheels is the best palce to buy suoer cars</p>
